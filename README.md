# Webcam Web App Outline

## Overview
This document outlines the structure and functionality of a web application that captures a webcam stream, displays it on an HTML canvas, and applies various effects to the stream using an intermediate canvas for image processing.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the video element, canvases, and controls.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `app.js`: The main JavaScript file that handles the webcam stream, canvas drawing, and effects.
- `effects.js`: A JavaScript file containing functions for different effects.
- `utils.js`: A JavaScript file for utility functions.
- `form-controller.js`: A JavaScript file for handling form input changes and storing effect data.

## HTML Structure
- A `<video>` element to capture the webcam stream.
- An intermediate `<canvas>` element for processing the image data.
- A primary `<canvas>` element to display the processed image data.
- Controls for selecting and applying effects, including sliders for adjusting pixel size for the pixelate effect, blur radius for the blur effect, edge detection strength for the edge detection effect, and brightness and contrast for the brightness and contrast effect.
- JavaScript files for app.js, effects.js, utils.js, and form-controller.js.
- Imports in each file are not required as they are all linked in the HTML file.

## CSS Styling
- Basic styling for layout and positioning.
- Styling for the video and canvas elements.
- Styling for the controls.

## JavaScript Functionality

### app.js
- Access the webcam stream using the MediaDevices API.
- Draw the webcam stream onto the intermediary canvas.
- Capture image data from the intermediary canvas for processing & effects and then pass it to the primary canvas for viewing.
- Apply selected effects to the image data and render the processed data back to the primary canvas.
- Handle user input for selecting and applying effects, including adjusting pixel size for the pixelate effect, blur radius for the blur effect, edge detection strength for the edge detection effect, and brightness and contrast for the brightness and contrast effect.

### effects.js
- Define various effects (e.g., grayscale, sepia, invert colors, blur, edge detection, brightness/contrast adjustment, pixelate, vignette, noise, color shift, mirror, glitch).
- Each effect function takes image data as input and returns the processed image data.

### utils.js
- Utility functions for common tasks (e.g., converting between image data formats, handling user input).
- Canvas utilities (e.g., drawImage, getImageData, putImageData, creating intermediate canvas).

### form-controller.js
- Listen for changes on the form element.
- Append values from the form data to an object stored on the window object (`window.effectData`).
- Initialize `effectData` with current form values on page load.

## Example Effects
- Grayscale: Convert the image to grayscale.
- Sepia: Apply a sepia tone to the image.
- Invert Colors: Invert the colors of the image.
- Blur: Apply a blur effect to the image.
- Edge Detection: Highlight the edges in the image.
- Brightness/Contrast Adjustment: Adjust the brightness and contrast of the image.
- Pixelate: Create a pixelated effect on the image.
- Vignette: Apply a vignette effect to the image.
- Noise: Add noise to the image.
- Color Shift: Shift the colors in the image.
- Mirror: Mirror one side of the image to the other.
- Kaleidoscope: Create a kaleidoscope effect by rotating and mirroring sections of the image.
- Glitch: Apply a glitch effect by randomly shifting sections of the image.
- Mosaic: Create a mosaic effect by dividing the image into tiles and applying different effects to each tile.
- Cartoon: Apply a cartoon effect by simplifying colors and adding edge outlines.
- Watercolor: Apply a watercolor effect by blending colors and adding texture.
- Oil Painting: Apply an oil painting effect by simulating brush strokes and texture.
- Thermal Vision: Apply a thermal vision effect by mapping colors to temperature ranges.
- Night Vision: Apply a night vision effect by enhancing brightness and adding a green tint.
- ASCII Art: Convert the image to ASCII art by mapping brightness levels to characters.
- Sketch: Apply a sketch effect by converting the image to black and white and adding pencil-like lines.
- Triangles: Create a geometric effect by dividing the image into triangles and applying colors based on the average pixel values.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more effects (e.g., additional artistic filters, real-time face detection).
- Allow users to save processed images.
- Implement performance optimizations for real-time processing.

## Conclusion
This outline provides a high-level overview of the webcam web app. The next steps involve creating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as described and implementing the functionality to capture, process, and display the webcam stream with various effects.
